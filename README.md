# Tools use
  - Django
  ### Why I use Django
  Django is an open-source python web framework used for rapid development, pragmatic, maintainable, clean design, and secures websites. For one thing, Django hides your website's source code. The framework has protection against XSS and CSRF attacks, SQL injections, clickjacking, etc. Django notifies of a number of common security mistakes better than PHP (you can count it as one of the main advantages of Django over PHP).
